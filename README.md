This repository was made in order to test myself using a test I was given way back in a job Interview.

Test description:

Create a program (website here since I will be using Javascript to solve this now) that records key presses if the typing speed is faster than 150ms.
Once the typing speed falls below 150ms the program stops and displays the last 6 key presses.
